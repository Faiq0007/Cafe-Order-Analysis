## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer order data from *Taste of the World Café*, a restaurant known for its diverse and generous portions. The café introduced a new menu at the beginning of the year, and I was tasked with evaluating customer responses to the menu items. This project was completed as part of a **Maven Analytics** course.

### Scenario
