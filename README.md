# Taste of the World Café: Menu Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is focused on analyzing customer order data for *Taste of the World Café*, a popular restaurant known for offering a wide range of dishes from different parts of the world. At the start of the year, the café launched a brand-new menu, and the management wants to assess customer reactions to this new offering.

As a **Data Analyst**, my task was to analyze the menu items and customer order data to identify:
1. Which menu items are performing well or poorly.
2. What the top customers seem to favor the most.

This project was part of a **Maven Analytics** course, designed to provide hands-on experience with SQL and real-world business scenarios.

## Scenario

As the Data Analyst for the *Taste of the World Café*, you have been tasked with helping the management understand how the new menu is being received by the customers. Using the available data, you will:
- Explore the **menu_items** table to understand what's available on the new menu.
- Investigate the **order_details** table to see customer order patterns.
- Combine data from both tables to uncover key insights into which items are most popular, which are underperforming, and what the top customers are ordering the most.

## Datasets

### 1. `menu_items` Table
This table contains information about the new menu introduced at the start of the year, including:
- **item_id**: Unique identifier for each menu item.
- **item_name**: The name of the menu item.
- **category**: The type of dish (e.g., appetizers, entrees, desserts).
- **price**: Price of each menu item.

### 2. `order_details` Table
This table records every order made by customers, including:
- **order_id**: Unique identifier for each order.
- **customer_id**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **item_id**: The menu item ordered.
- **quantity**: The number of units of a particular item in each order.
- **order_date**: The date when the order was placed.

## Tools Used

- **MySQL**: All data analysis and insights were derived using SQL queries to extract meaningful patterns and trends from the data.
- **Maven Analytics**: Platform used for project resources and guidance.
